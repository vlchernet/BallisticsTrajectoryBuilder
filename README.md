# BallisticsTrajectoryBuilder
This application is intended as visual demonstration of material point's cynematics.
Try to change angle, initial velocity to get different trajectories and compare them.
If your curves will not be placed as whole in the given space change the scale of area.
And as it is clear you may substitute this movement equation to any other one . For example  it would be useful to take into account air resistance for more reality.
